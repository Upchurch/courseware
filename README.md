courseware
==========

A framework for online courses, including testing, built in Adobe Flex MXML/ActionScript. (Now, Adobe Flash Builder)

I built this version of the courseware back in 2008-2009, some of which is still in use. With the agreement of the
parties involved, I am open sourcing it so that old clients and, perhaps, new programmers may have access to the 
code. 

Included is an example course. The interesting bits are the xml files, which defines the content of the courses, 
and the mxml files with outlines the frames and styles of the course.
