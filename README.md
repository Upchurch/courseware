courseware
==========

A framework for online courses, including testing, built in Adobe Flex MXML/ActionScript. (Now, Adobe Flash Builder)

I built this version of the courseware back in 2008-2009, some of which is still in use. With the agreement of the
parties involved, I am open sourcing it so that old clients and, perhaps, new programmers may have access to the 
code. Currently, I only have the shared library committed. I will add course examples and clean up the library over 
the next week or so.
